         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Et conturbata mater carnis meae, quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; ſempiternam ſalutem meam charius parturiebat:</hi> She ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſorer pangs that I might be borne againe, then She did at my firſt Birth; when in ſorrow ſhe brought me forth into the world: Witneſſe her laſt dying words; which at her laſt farewell, at the point of her death, ſhe did with deare affection expreſſe, looking upon me ſtedfaſtly, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>O Sonne, take heed how thou ſinneſt againſt God at any time:</hi> And I may truly ſay of her as the ſame Father ſpeaketh in the firſt of his <hi>Confeſſions: An dicam vitam mortalem, an mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem vitalem, neſcio?</hi> Whether her whole life, was a dying life, or a living death, I cannot tell: but this I can tell (to my hearts griefe) her gray haires were brought downe with ſorrow to the grave. Thus you ſee my hinderances, yet at laſt, <hi>(Poſt varios caſus, poſt tot diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina rerum)</hi> I have here preſented my anſwer to the Printed Sermon: And that I undertake this worke, is not out of hatred to the man, but love to the truth, and to your ſoules: let me adviſe you in our Saviours
<pb facs="tcp:159085:6"/>words, to take heed what you heare: and be not toſſed to and fro with every winde of Doctrine. He gives his booke this Title: <hi>The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of John Baptiſt.</hi> And yet every one may ſee, he doth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Sermon Preach downe <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine; as if of purpoſe he did intend to confute it: Take heed of woolves in Sheepes clothing. <hi>Aul. Gellius, lib. 2. Noct.

Here is Chriſt pretended, and Chriſtianity, but Faith, and Repentance, and Charity cryed downe, which are the inſide of a Chriſtian: And men may pretend the Preaching of Free Grace, and Chriſt, and this may make a faire ſhew: but unleſſe you ſee Faith working by love and repentance, you cannot ſee a Chriſtian, but an Antichriſtian. I am glad I have this love-token to leave with you, whom I alwayes did, and ever ſhall wiſh well: I had, while I lived with you a trembling care for your Soules good: And I can ſpeake it with a ſafe conſcience: I never wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grieved any in the Towne. If from ſome I had hatred for my good will: I leave all to God, who in time will lay every mans ſinne at his owne doore: I deſire it may be in mercy to their Soules. At my remove from you ſome imbittered Spirits did invenom their tongues againſt me; (and yet would appeare to the world as Angels of light) at whoſe hands I have deſerved better: I may take up the Prophets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; <hi>They ſaid, Let us ſmite him with the tongue, and then we will regard none of his words:</hi> And it is the Devils policy to raiſe an evill report againſt our perſons: that ſo he might take away the power of our Miniſtery from the hearts of men that are our hearers; but I thank God, who hath wrought otherwiſe in the hearts of moſt of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with whom now I live, whom I deſire to be followers of me, ſo far forth as I am a follower of Chriſt: I ſpeake not out of pride, or ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in regard of my ſelfe: I thanke God I have learned quietly to paſſe by evill report: but in reſpect of my Minſtery, Let my accuſers be brought to my face: if I cannot make a Chriſtian anſwer, to what any man can lay to my charge, then let me be blamed: I can truely ſay I have cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And God knowes my heart, my care hath beene more to inrich my ſelfe with inward abilities for my place, than to get outward ability by my place: I ever tooke more care for the ſtate of my peoples ſoules, than for my outward eſtate: And now Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up; and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctifyed: And thus I reſt</p>

Is this preaching Chriſt and free grace? but I ſay, a man may want in his owne appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion this aſſurance; and yet he may have Faith; Gods people ſometimes are in ſuch a condition, that they cannot ſee ſo much as a glimpſe of Gods favour; Nay the contrary: They conclude themſelves forſaken of God, and caſt-awayes; what's become now of aſſurance? but for all this, dare any man ſay that men in this condition have no Faith? Nay, they are upheld by the ſecret ſupport of Faith; otherwiſe, in ſuch a condition they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire as <hi>Judas</hi> did: but it is plaine by Scripture, that a childe of God may want aſſurance, and yet by Faith ſtay himſelfe upon God, <hi>Iſay</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the voyce of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſſe, and hath no light? let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelfe upon his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take faith for the act of Faith, apprehending the object, and ſo we are juſtified by faith onely in the ſight of God: in regard whereof the ſalvation of all that truely beleeve is ſure and certaine, though they perhaps be not aſſured thereof, for this is the promiſe of the Goſpell, that whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh, but have life everlaſting.</p>

            <p>To this I anſwer, This place hath reference to <hi>Num.</hi> 19. The Apoſtles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is from the leſſer, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment runs thus: If the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the uncleane, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh, how much more ſhal the blood of Chriſt purge your conſciences? &amp;c. This aſhes did ſanctifie the uncleane, to the purifying of the fleſh, becauſe thoſe who for their outward uncleanneſſe, were excluded from the Congregation, by the ſprinkling of the water of cleanſing were ceremonially made clean ſo that it was lawfull for them to come to the Sanctuary of the Lord: Not for that this purifying did onely extend it ſelfe to the fleſh, and was meerely carnall, for then the people of the Jewes ſhould no whit differ from the heathens: who had their ſacrifices meerely carnall; by which they might blot out the infamy of their hainous crimes: And to expound this place as he doth, is (in <hi>Calvins</hi> phraſe) an expoſition too much prophane: If their dayly ſacrifices did not prefigure the Meſſias, and were not done out of ſpirituall reſpects, what was their Temple, but a Butchers ſhambles? In this that the Law ſanctifyeth to the purifying of the fleſh, there was a ſpirituall ſignification: for as the outward uncleanneſſe did admoniſh the people of their inward impurity before God; ſo the ſprinkling by the water of ſeparation, and the receiving of thoſe that were ſprinkled, into the congregation, did ſignifie to beleevers their ſpirituall ſprinkling, and cleanſing by the blood of Chriſt, by which alone there is a way laid wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for ſinners to come into the ſight of God; and with boldneſſe to have acceſſe to the Throne of Grace. To limit therefore, and bound the legall rites onely to the purifying of the fleſh, (as he doth by his falſe expoſition) and to reſtraine the effect of them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:159085:35"/>onely to civill and politique Government, is injurious to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, made to his people, who lived in the time of the Law. Sacraments and ſignes have a ſpirituall ſignification, ſo that this purifying of the fleſh by the water of ſeparation, (ſo called becauſe ſuch as were ſeparated for any uncleanneſſe were ſprinkled with it) did ſignify unto the people of the Jews, the purifying of the conſcience by the blood of Chriſt; now then joyne the

And believers in the time of the Law, by their Sacrifices, which they were commanded of God to offer, were put in minde of the bloud of Chriſt, which by faith they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their Conſciences, and were thereby freed from the guilt of ſinne; and ſo had no more conſcience of ſinnes: their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences being by faith ſprinkled with the bloud of Chriſt, as well as our Conſciences who live now in the time of the Goſpell.

            <p>Firſt, remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>Marke</hi> 1.4. <hi>John did preach the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of repentance for the remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> Thus while hee inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles his booke [<hi>Johns</hi> doctrine] hee labours as much as in him lyeth, to overthrow <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent therefore and bee converted, that your ſinnes may bee blotted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the favour of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee, becauſe hee hath annointed mee to preach the Goſpel to the poore; he hath ſent mee to heale the broken hearted, to preach de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the Captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind: to ſet at libertie thoſe that are bruiſed; to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord: Luke</hi> 15.7. <hi>Joy ſhall bee in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth:</hi> as you may ſee in the parable of the Prodigall.</p>

            <p>The Sixth, is Salvation and life eternall, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Then hath God alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh, is Freedome from temporall puniſhments, or to be ſure, a mitigation of them, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10. <hi>And God ſaw their workes, that they turned from their evill wayes, and God repented of the evill that he had ſaid,</hi> 2 Chron. 12.12. <hi>And when he humbled himſelfe, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, that he would not deſtroy him altogether.</hi>

            <p>This objection was not made when he Preacht; but was put to him ſince, and he could not anſwer it: 'Tis ſtrange, that having ſo long time, before he Printed his Sermon, that he ſhould in Print ſay, he had not leiſure to remove it: But I beleeve him, for this place doth tell him to his face, that his Doctrine is falſe: and this he will never be able to remove.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is a new manner of eating Chriſt in the Sacrament, which cannot be proved by Scripture: There is in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, a threefold

Now all true beleevers doe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eat the body and blood of Chriſt, which really and indeed is taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, not with the mouth of the body corporally, but with the mouth of Faith ſpiritually: The manner of their eating was by Faith, ours is the ſame: To ſay a man eats a thing to come, (is a groſſe piece of non-ſenſe) How can that be? can one eate that which he hath not? can he eate bread to come? Chriſt was as really preſent to the Fathers, in their Sacrament of the Euchariſt, as he is to us in the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: (But that I may not be miſtaken, I will ſet downe what I meane by Chriſts reall preſence in the Sacrament) though we hold a reall preſence of Chriſts body and blood in the Sacrament, yet doe we not take it to be locall, bodily or ſubſtantiall, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and myſticall. Firſt, to the ſignes by Sacramentall relation: Secondly, to the Communicants by Faith alone. The firſt ſtands in this: That when the elements of Bread and Wine are preſent to the hand, and to the mouth of the receiver; at the very ſame time, the body and blood of Chriſt, are preſented to the minde: thus, and no otherwiſe, is Chriſt preſent with the ſignes. The ſecond preſence, in reſpect of the Communicants, is, that Chriſt is really preſent to their beleeving hearts: They by Faith applying when God gives Chriſt with his benefits, and man for his part by Faith receives the ſame as they are given: There ariſeth that union which is betweene every good receiver and Chriſt himſelfe; which union is not forged, but a reall, true, and neare conjunction, nearer then which none is or can be, becauſe it is made by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne giving and receiving, that paſſeth betweene God and Man; as alſo by the bond of one and the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p>To come then to the point, conſidering there is a reall union, and conſequently, a reall communion betweene us and Chriſt; there muſt needs be ſuch a kinde of preſence wherein Chriſt is truely,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:159085:51"/>and really preſent, to the heart of him that receives the Sacrament in Faith: And ſuch a reall Communion was there betweene the Fathers and Chriſt: and ſuch a preſence wherein Chriſt was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent to them in the Old Teſtament, who received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in Faith. We conclude then, they did cate Chriſt preſent. If it be objected, Chriſt was not in their time come in the fleſh. The Apoſtle makes anſwer,

            <p>To this I anſwer, there was a whiſpering at the Aſſize ſome yeares paſt: That there was a great Malefactor (as it ſeemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) to cloake his owne guilt, would have condemned, and did accuſe the innocent.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:159085:51"/>true zeale, it had beene an undoubted marke of a true Chriſtian: bat his words were when he preacht; That people might make a ſtrict conſcience of the obſervation of the Sabbath, and yet ſtone Chriſt out of the Church: which to me ſeemes to be a lewd ſpeech; ſtrictneſſe implying ſinceritie; beſides they that queſtioned our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did it not ſo much out of conſcience as humour.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, if he ſpeakes of every defire of ſalvation, the queſtion is needleſſe; and to propound a queſtion of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence without further expreſſing himſelfe, is but to ſet a Trap to inſnare weake conſciences; and to handle the word deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; But I anſwer, an unfained deſire of ſalvation in a ſanctified uſe of the meanes, is an infallible note of ſalvation. Give mee leave to explaine my ſelfe thus. The difference and degrees of Faith are two. Firſt, A weake Faith. Secondly, A ſtrong Faith. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt. The weake Faith ſheweth it ſelfe by this grace of God, namely, an unfained deſire, not onely of ſalvation, (for that a wicked and graceleſſe man may have) but of reconciliation with God in Chriſt. This is a ſure ſigne of Faith in every touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and humbled heart: and it is peculiar to the elect; and they which have this, have in them alſo the ground and ſubſtance of true ſaving Faith. Reaſon to prove this; Firſt, the promiſe of life everlaſting is made to the deſire of reconciliation.

            <p>Secondly, the hungring deſire after grace is a ſanctified affection; where one affection is ſanctified, all are ſanctified; where all are ſanctified, the whole man is ſanctified; and he that is ſanctified, is juſtified and beleeves, and ſhall infallibly be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God accepts the will and deſire to beleeve for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and beleeving indeed: wherefore this deſire of reconciliation (if it be ſoundly wrought in the heart) is in acceptation with God as true faith indeed. Tis confeſſed that there bee many and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry fleeting motions and deſires to doe good things; which grow to no iſſue or head, but in time vaniſh as they come: Now theſe are not true deſires after ſalvation, but rather flaſhing humours, and ſudden paſſions. Such have no ſoundneſſe in them; and muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the true deſire of reconciliation with God, that comes from a bruiſed heart, and brings alwayes reformation of life: And thus I have anſwered both his queſtions.</p>

I ſay againe, cheere up your hearts; The gates of Hell ſhall never prevaile againſt you, you are rich in grace and all the pretious promiſes of the Goſpel belong to you; and all the riches of Gods mercie in Chriſt Jeſus are yours; what ſhall I ſay more? I conclude, God is yours, Chriſt is yours, and all is yours.</p>

            <p>Now we are come to the third queſtion laid downe in Page the 74. at the latter end: <hi>Whether when Faith lies hid, that wee cannot ſee that we beleeve by the inward Teſtimony of our conſcience, that it is poſsible our workes of pietie or charitie can aſſure us of ſalvation?</hi> his anſwer is: <hi>I ſay no; and my reaſons are theſe.</hi>

            <p>Pag. 75. <hi>What workes are done in Faith</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that the ſame acts may not be done in the ſpirit of bondage?

I have heard of a very godly Miniſter, who (as I take it) being ſicke to death was much troubled about his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and doubted whether he did belong to God or no? at the laſt, Well, ſayes he, the devill ſhall never gull me; I have one evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will aſſure me without faile, I am certaine I love Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo gathered comfort: Upon theſe grounds I am bold to determine the queſtion affirmatively; That although Faith lies hid for the preſent, yet a man from workes of pietie, and charitie, which he findes in himſelfe, may have aſſurance that he doth beleeve, and ſo is in the ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>In his conference, pag. 12. he doth confeſſe: <hi>Where unfained love to the brethren is found, it may be a teſtimony of grace received;</hi> but
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:159085:54"/>he objects <hi>How ſhall I know?</hi> (his anſwer is) <hi>That unleſſe we beleeve truely, we cannot know we love unfainedly, therefore though our love heare witneſſe to our Faith before men, yet our Faith beares witneſſe to our love in the ſecrets of our heart; neither can it ever appeare to bee true love, that proceeds not from a heart firſt imbracing Chriſt by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, by my loving unfainedly I know I beleeve truely; the truth of my worke being an infallible evidence of the truth of my Faith; and I can trie my worke by the ſure rule of the Word which will not faile: and thus though I cannot ſee my Faith formally, yet I can ſee it effectively, I meane in its effective energie and efficacie. Againe, our love doth not onely beare witneſſe to our Faith before men, but alſo to our ſelves, that we doe beleeve; our conſciences telling us that it is ſuch a love that muſt needs flow from Faith, and be a fruit and effect of it.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:159085:55"/>for he that in Truth hath this witneſſe, is infallibly certaine of the greater, and may by this, know that he hath that: I meane <hi>Faith:</hi> if by it, he underſtands the greater. They are curſed ſpeeches of the ſicke man, to ſay, <hi>Hell gapes for him; he ſhall be damned; And curſed be the time that ever I laid a foundation upon the ſands.</hi> As though to affirme, that unfained love to the brethren is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble note of true beleevers, were to lay a foundation upon the ſands, whereas the Apoſtle affirmes as much.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> ſpeaking of the right way of miniſtring comfort to a party diſtreſſed, layes this downe for one ground, Namely, to love any man becauſe he is a Chriſtian, and a childe of God, is a ſenſible and certaine note of a man that is partaker of the true love of God in Chriſt: and he proves it by this place we are upon, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. Having laid downe this ground, (ſaith he) The way whereby the party in diſtreſſe, may be brought within the compaſſe of the promiſe of Salvation, ſtands in two things, in making tryall, and applying of the promiſe. Firſt, when a man is in the fit of Tentation, he will ſay reſolutely, he is ſure to be damned: Aske him in this fit, of his love to God, he will anſwer, he hath none at all: but aske him further; whether he love a man becauſe he is a Chriſtian and a Childe of God? then he will ſay, he doth indeed. In the ſecond place, the applying of the promiſe of life everlaſting to the party diſtreſſed; And that is done by a kinde of reaſoning: The firſt part whereof is taken from the Word of God: The ſecond, from the teſtimony of the diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; And the concluſion is the applying of the promiſe on this manner:
<note place="margin">Major, Minor.</note> He that loves a man becauſe he is a Chriſtian and a childe of God, is certainely himſelfe a true childe of God. But thou loveſt a man becauſe he is a Chriſtian and a childe of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art a childe of God,
<note place="margin">Concluſ.</note> and art tranſlated from death to life, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes.</p>
            <p>Another ground of comfort for a party diſtreſſed, Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> layes downe from the unfaigned deſire after grace, which he in his Conference, <hi>Page</hi> 3. and in his Booke, <hi>Page</hi> 74. doth utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Firſt (ſaith Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi>) let the comforter aske the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in diſtreſſe, whether he beleeve, and repent? The diſtreſſed party anſwers no, he cannot repent, nor beleeve: Then we muſt further aske, whether he doth deſire to beleeve and repent? To
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:159085:55"/>this he will anſwer, he doth deſire it with all his heart: Now for applying the promiſe to the diſtreſſed, the Argument will run thus: He that hath an unfained deſire to repent and beleeve, hath remiſſion of ſins and life everlaſting:
<note place="margin">Major. Minor. Coneluſ.</note> But thou haſt an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to repent and beleeve in Chriſt: Therefore, remiſſion of ſinnes and life everlaſting is thine. Thus Maſter <hi>Perkins.</hi> But that I may comfort the poore weake Chriſtian againſt ſuch Doctrine as this, <hi>That ſuch as doe deſire to beleeve, doe not beleeve;</hi> I will conclude with an Example I have read in the workes of that famous Divine Maſter <hi>Greenham,</hi> who tels of one Maſter <hi>Chambers</hi> of <hi>Leyceſter,</hi> who in his ſickeneſſe grievouſly deſpaired, and cryed out that he was damned, and after dyed: yet it is not for any to note him (ſayes he) with the blacke marke of a reprobate. One thing which he ſpake in his extremity (O that I had but one drop of Faith!) muſt move all men to conceive well of him: for by this it ſeemeth he had an heart, which deſired to repent and beleeve: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a repentant and beleeving heart indeed. Blame me not for having a ſecond bout at ſuch Doctrine as this, ſo deſtructive to poore diſtreſſed Conſciences, ſo contrary to the Word of God, and againſt the experience of every true broken hearted Chriſtian. What Doctrine ſoever tends to the vilifying of a ſanctified life, is a Doctrine of devils, though it appeare as an Angell of light: And ſuch as labour to make the Law of God of no uſe (not ſo much as a rule of life) to a beleever, doe deny the Kingly Office of Chriſt, and they are Antichriſt: Now the Lord give us broken hearts, that we may be low in our owne eyes, and not be led by our owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: but that we may be guided by the Spirit of truth, according to the word of Truth. I will preſent you with the golden chaine of Salvation, and I have done.</p>
